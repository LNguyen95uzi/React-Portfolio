# React-Portfolio

This is my portfolio to showcase myself and my work as a student of web development to the world! Now using React!

## Info

This website was constructed using bootstrap to include a responsive layout, respnsive images, and a sticky footer.

I built this project to further enhance my recently acquired coding skills and to eventually showcase my work to future potential employers. I learned a lot during the past week and am glad to attempt to tie it all in to this project and to further expand on it upon learning new material within the next few months. 

Thank you,
LPN
