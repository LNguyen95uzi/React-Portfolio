                    <p>I currently reside in Philadelphia, PA and am looking for any and all
                    opportunites in
                    this wonderful city as well as abroad! I am an avid traveller and would love to take my
                    skills
                    around the world with me! I believe understanding and immersing oneself in cultures outside
                    of what
                    we are raised in help develop and open our minds to be more accepting and learning of great
                    values!
                    Besides travelling, I enjoy cooking, video games, hiking, kayaking, and music festivals! I
                    am
                    currently skilled in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Node.js, MySQL, and MongoDB. Soon to be learning
                    React
                            and Python!</p>
